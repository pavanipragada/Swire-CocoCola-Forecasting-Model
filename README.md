# Swire-CocoCola-Forecasting-Model

# Business Problem
Swire Coca-Cola, a leading beverage manufacturer, is faced with the challenge of accurately forecasting demand for its innovative products. The beverage industry continues to evolve due to changes in consumer preferences, technological advancements, and an increasing focus on sustainability and health. Successfully launching innovative products is vital for revenue growth and maintaining competitiveness in the market. The primary objective of this project is to develop a forecast model that predicts the weekly demand for Swire's new innovative products, utilizing historical data, relevant census data, and considering factors such as seasonality, trends, and other influencers.

# Solution 
To address this business challenge, we developed a robust demand forecasting model. This model leverages historical sales data from similar products to accurately predict the demand for Swire Coca-Cola's new innovative products, as well as identify the best performing regions for these products. Our approach includes a thorough analysis of trends and seasonal patterns.

# My Contributions
I was responsible for integrating various datasets, which allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. By analyzing different plots, I identified key relationships crucial for enhancing the accuracy of our demand forecasting model. I actively participated in creating insightful visualizations, which facilitated a deeper understanding of complex data patterns, thus aiding our strategic decision-making. I contributed to the development and evaluation of a Random Forest model, ensuring it effectively addressed our business challenges by handling large datasets and modeling nonlinear relationships. Additionally, I participated in problem-solving sessions and meticulously proofread our project documentation to maintain clarity and accuracy in our communications.

# Business Value of the Solution
The business value of our demand forecasting solution for Swire Coca-Cola is substantial. By implementing this robust predictive model, the company can more accurately forecast weekly demand for its innovative products and identify the best performing regions. This precision allows Swire Coca-Cola to better align its production and inventory strategies with actual market demands, thereby minimizing overproduction, reducing waste, and optimizing inventory levels. Such efficiency not only leads to significant cost savings but also enhances the companyâ€™s ability to swiftly adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences.

# Challenges encountered
Handling the enormous main dataset was one of our biggest challenges. As a team, we conducted extensive research on how to effectively manage such large datasets, extracting maximum value for our analysis and forecast model development. Another significant challenge was ensuring that all team members were on the same page and had a thorough understanding of the data. Additionally, incorporating a geographic aspect to determine the best performing regions added complexity to the project. To overcome these challenges, we held multiple meetings to understand each other's perspectives and effectively collaborated, utilizing online resources to ensure the success of our project.

# My Learnings
I greatly valued the opportunity to collaborate with the team and advance through the various stages of the project, where I engaged with real-time company data and developed forecasting models for the first time. Through this experience, I acquired a profound understanding of how demand is influenced by factors such as seasonality, marketing strategies, and geographic variables. A critical skill I developed was the ability to interpret analytical results in business terms and communicate these insights effectively to executive leadership. This project has become one of my key talking points, about which I can speak confidently.
